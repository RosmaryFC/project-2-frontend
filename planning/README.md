## Project Description

[Link to final project](https://rosmaryfermin.netlify.app/)

Introducing, Our Unit-1 project for General Assembly's SEI program.
For Project 1, I will be creating a personal website that displays work I have done so far throughout the program. This project will include a 
* home page - which has a little about me, my goals, and my hobbies?
* projects/resume page - holds a pdf version of my resume, also displays a list of projects I've worked on.
* Each page will have a footer - that links to my github, LinkedIn, and a little box where you can contact me?

* I'll be using the color combination Rosy Dew, found on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/rosy-dew/).
  * Check out their color palettes [here](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/)!
  * If there is a color palette you'd like to make based on a color you'd like, Canva recommends using this [color wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/).
  * More info on website color schemese [here](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/).

Some inspiration for animations has come from [pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/fellowship). I also really like their web design.
A lot of inspiration came from exercises we've worked on in class.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were done using [Mockflow](https://mockflow.com/app/#Wireframe).
Below are the wireframes for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Header section - has navigation bar, a picture of myself, a background image, my name and title
- About Me  section - has a small about me blurp
- Projects section - lists prjects in a grid format. On hover, it shows a small blurp of the project
- Contact Me section - has links to github, email, and linked in. has text box where user can type in and send an email
- Responsive Layout Tablet - make website responsive for devices under 900px
- Responsive layout Mobile - make website responsive to devices under 350px

#### PostMVP 

- Animations
  * Animations for Nav Bar 
  * Animations for projects appearing

## Functional Components

I've broken down each part of the website to smaller tasks below.

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project.
 - JQuery - allowed me to easily populate my porject divs into the webpage as well take user information and push it into a googleform sheet.
 - font-awesome - I used this to set the different fonts of the page.
 - Google Sheets - I use google sheets as a data base for the forms and my projects.



## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

For the form section, I followed along with [this]() tutorial to create a google script that takes in the values of what is put into the form and puts it into a google sheet.

```
//this piece of code the google script
function doGet(e) {
  var op = e.parameter.action;
  var url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P85QuIhm_NNsDkEvsXSc6MfYfWpGZDuXhFmZVA05SVg/edit?usp=sharing";
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(url);
  var sheet = ss.getSheetByName("Sheet1");
  if(op="insert")
    return insert_value(e,sheet);
}

function insert_value(request,sheet){
  var d = new Date();
  var currentTime = d.toLocaleString();
  var name = request.parameter.formname;
  var email = request.parameter.formemail;
  var message = request.parameter.formmessage;
  
  var rowContents = [currentTime,name, email, message];
  var rowData = sheet.appendRow(rowContents);
  var result="Insertion Seccessful";
  
  result = JSON.stringify({
    "result": result
  });
  
  return ContentService
   .createTextOutput(request.parameter.callback + "(" + result + ")")
   .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JAVASCRIPT);
  
}
```

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

 I wanted to be able to easily change colors down the line: found this [site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) that helped me set colors to variables. Another [site](https://css-tricks.com/breaking-css-custom-properties-out-of-root-might-be-a-good-idea/) relating to topic.

 I was trying to figure out how to sned an email through the form element. I initially was trying to follow [this](https://blog.mailtrap.io/javascript-send-email/) tutorial which was going to amke me create a server and I feel was more for sending emails to users. I felt like there was a easier way, and I heard about others using google forms. Then I came across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cx-ZjawL6Q) tutorial that shows you how to use your form data to upload data into a google sheet without creating servers or anything like that.
