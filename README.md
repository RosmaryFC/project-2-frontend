## Project Description

Link to final project: <b>WILL ADD LATER</b>

Introducing, Our Unit-2 project for General Assembly's SEI program.
For Project 12, I will be creating a fullstack website for my karate school to manage students with their payments and progress.
 The frontend will include:
 * a bar to choose between populating students or parents
 * a search bar that can search students or parents by their name, Id, phone number, etc.
 * an option to add a student or parent
 * a table that populates a list of students or a list of parents
 * an option to edit each student or parent info
 * an option to delete a student or parent
 * an option to create a student or parent


* I am considering using some of these color combinations found on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/)
   * [Melted Chocolate](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/melted-chocolate/)
   * [Bonfire Glow](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/bonfire-glow/)
   * [Metal and Glass](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/metal-and-glass/)
   * [Secret Romance](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/secret-romance/)

* If there is a color palette you'd like to make based on a color you'd like, Canva recommends using this [color wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/).
* More info on website color schemese [here](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/).

Some inspiration for animations has come from [pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/fellowship). I also really like their web design.
Other inspiration will come from T-mobiles client management system since I worked there for a few years. Also, facebooks website and how they display posts, and just their overall updating options.

## Wireframes

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Header section - student / parent option as well as school logo
- search section - search bar, and bew student button
- table section - displays list of students or parents
- create student/parent text box - appears after clicking create student/parent button
- edit student/parent text box - appears when clicking student/parent
- delete student - after clicking edit student, there will be an option to delete student
- Responsive Layout Tablet - make website responsive for devices under 900px
- Responsive layout Mobile - make website responsive to devices under 350px
- create hamburger menu for mobile layout

#### PostMVP 

*  Animations
   * Animations for Nav Bar 
   * Animations for expanding student info in tablet and mobile layout

* when student is past due, highlight red
* order by name, age, rank, due date


## Functional Components

I've broken down each part of the website to smaller tasks below.

## Additional Libraries
 This section lists all supporting libraries or tools and their role in the project.
 - JQuery - allowed me to easily populate my porject divs into the webpage as well take user information and push it into a googleform sheet.
 - font-awesome - I used this to set the different fonts of the page.
 - Google Sheets - I use google sheets as a data base for the forms and my projects.
